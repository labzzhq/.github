# Governance of Labzz

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Authors

Labzz HQ acts as the Project Author. The project author is responsible for governance, standards, and the direction of the project. To summarize:

- The project author decides which new projects should be part of the Labzz umbrella.
- The project author is responsible for assigning leaders to projects and transferring projects to a new leader when an existing leader steps down.
- It is the responsibility of the author to share/document the vision of the framework and keep project leaders in sync with it.

### Project Leaders

Labzz is a combination of several packages created and managed by the core team. All these packages are led by a project leader selected by the Project Author.

In almost all cases, the package creator acts as the project leader, as they are the ones who initially put in the effort to bring the idea to life.

The project leader has the final say in all aspects of decision-making within the project. However, since the community always has the ability to fork, this person is entirely accountable to the community. It is the project leader’s responsibility to set the strategic goals of the project and communicate them clearly to the community. They also need to understand the community as a whole and strive to satisfy as many conflicting needs as possible, ensuring that the project survives in the long term.

In many ways, the project leader’s role is about diplomacy. The key is to ensure that as the project expands, the right people are given influence over it, and the community rallies around the project leader’s vision. The leader’s job is then to ensure that the core team members (see below) make the right decisions on behalf of the project. Generally speaking, as long as the core team members are aligned with the project’s strategy, the project leader will allow them to proceed as they see fit.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A project leader cannot archive or decide to remove the project from the Labzz umbrella. They can decide to stop working on the project, in which case we will find a new project leader.

### Core Team

Core team members are contributors who have made several valuable contributions to the project and are now responsible for writing code directly into the repository and reviewing others' contributions. In many cases, they are programmers, but they may also contribute in a different role, such as community engagement. Typically, a core team member will focus on a specific aspect of the project and bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the project leader. The role of a core team member is not official; it is simply a position that influential community members will find themselves in as the project leader looks to them for guidance and support.

Core team members do not have authority over the overall direction of the project. However, they have the attention of the project leader. It is a core team member’s job to ensure that the leader is aware of the community’s needs and collective goals and to help develop or obtain appropriate contributions for the project. Often, core team members are given informal control over their specific areas of responsibility and are granted rights to modify certain areas of the source code directly. That is, while core team members do not have explicit decision-making authority, they often find that their actions are synonymous with decisions made by the leader.

#### Active Core Team Members

Active core team members contribute to the project regularly. An active core team member will usually have two or more areas of focus - in the most common cases, they will be responsible for regular issue triage, bug fixing, documentation improvements, or feature development in a subproject repository.

#### Emeritus Core Team

Some core team members who have made valuable contributions in the past may no longer be able to commit to the same level of participation today for various reasons. This is perfectly normal, and any past contributions to the project are still highly appreciated. These core team members are honored for their contributions as Emeritus Core Team and are welcome to resume active participation at any time.

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who do not wish to become core team members or have not yet had the opportunity given by the project leader. They make valuable contributions as described in the list below but generally do not have the authority to make direct changes to the project’s code. Contributors engage with the project through communication tools such as GitHub RFC discussions, issues, and pull requests, Discord chat room, and the forum.

Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, specific skill requirements, or selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply needs to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.

Some contributors may already be engaging with the project as users but will also find themselves performing one or more of the following actions:

- Supporting new users (current users often provide the most effective support for new users)
- Reporting bugs
- Identifying requirements
- Coding
- Assisting with project infrastructure
- Fixing bugs
- Adding features

As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, they may find that the project leader begins to trust them more and more. When this starts to happen, they gradually take on the role of a core team member as described above.

### Users

Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the community: without them, the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no specific requirements.

Users should be encouraged to participate in the life of the project and community as much as possible. User contributions allow the project team to ensure they are meeting the needs of these users. Common user activities include (but are not limited to):

- Evangelizing about the project.
- Informing developers about the strengths and weaknesses of the project from a new user’s perspective.
- Providing moral support (a 'thank you' is very important).
- Providing financial support through GitHub sponsors.

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find themselves becoming more and more involved. These users may then become contributors, as described above.

## Support

All community participants are encouraged to provide support for new users within the project’s management infrastructure. This support is provided as a way to grow the community. Those seeking support should recognize that all support activity within the project is voluntary and therefore provided as time permits. A user who requires guaranteed response times or outcomes should, therefore, seek to acquire a support contract. However, for those willing to engage with the project on its terms and willing to help support other users, community support channels are ideal.

### Monetary Donations

For an open development project, money is less important than active contribution. However, some people or organizations have plenty of money and little time and prefer to make their contribution in cash. If you wish to make a significant donation, you can sponsor us to implement a new feature or fix some bugs. The project website provides clear guidance on how to make a donation.

If you run a business using the project as a revenue-generating product, it makes commercial sense to sponsor its development. This ensures that the project your product depends on remains healthy and is actively maintained. It can also improve exposure in our community and make it easier to attract new developers.

## Branding and Ownership

Labzz is a registered trademark of Labzz HQ.

Only projects under the npm scope `@labzz` and the Labzz organization on GitHub are managed and officially supported by the core team.

Furthermore, you should not use the Labzz name or logos in a way that may falsely imply any official connection with or endorsement by Labzz. Any use of the Labzz name or logos in a way that may cause customer confusion is not permitted.

This includes naming a product or service in a way that emphasizes the Labzz brand, such as "Labzz UIKit" or "Labzz Studio," as well as domain names like "[invalid URL removed]".

Instead, you should use your own branding in a way that clearly differentiates it from Labzz.

Additionally, you may not use our trademarks on t-shirts, stickers, or other merchandise without explicit written consent.

## Projects under the Labzz Umbrella

Projects under the Labzz umbrella are the intellectual property of the Project Author. Once a project created by a project leader becomes part of the "Labzz organization on GitHub" or is published under the npm scope `@labzzhq`, project leaders cannot delete or abandon the project, and all community support will always be welcome.
